// a reducer is a pure function that takes initial state and an action object

// building up a reducer is like teaching it to understand different actions 

// it must return a whole new version of the original state that reflects the modifications entailed by the action type

// don't forget the default case for when the action type doesn't apply for this particular reducer

// import action types

// teach the reducer to handle different action types

// export default reducerFunctionReference

const deck = (state = [], action) => {
  // actions -- changing the deck
  switch (action.type) {
    default:
      return state; 
  }
};

export default deck;
